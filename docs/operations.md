# Operations Notes

## Troubleshooting

- If `pnpm test` fails with missing browser APIs, ensure the `jsdom` dependency is installed.
- If workspace package resolution fails, run `pnpm install` from the repository root (not inside a subpackage).
- If Node version is older than 22, switch runtime before running commands.
- If API startup fails with a tmux error, install `tmux` and verify `tmux -V` works in your shell.

## Quality gates

- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Triggered on push to `main` and on pull requests.
- Runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build`.

## Runtime persistence notes

- Tentacle metadata is persisted at `.octogent/state/tentacles.json`.
- Frontend UI preference state is persisted in the same registry under `uiState`.
- Runtime restores tentacles from that registry on startup and does not auto-create a default tentacle.
- Runtime restores UI state from that registry on startup and serves it via `GET /api/ui-state`.
- Each tentacle maps to a tmux session named `octogent_<tentacleId>`.
- `workspaceMode: "shared"` tentacles run in the main workspace root.
- `workspaceMode: "worktree"` tentacles run in `.octogent/worktrees/<tentacleId>`.
- Orphan tmux sessions without a registry entry are ignored.
- `DELETE /api/tentacles/:tentacleId` removes both registry state and the associated tmux session.
- Deleting a worktree tentacle does not remove its git worktree directory or branch automatically.
- `PATCH /api/ui-state` updates and persists frontend UI preferences.

## Local security defaults

- API defaults to `HOST=127.0.0.1`.
- HTTP and WebSocket requests are restricted to loopback `Host` and browser `Origin` values by default.
- For intentionally remote setups, set `OCTOGENT_ALLOW_REMOTE_ACCESS=1`.

## Known limitations (scratch baseline)

- Full multi-user auth/session model is not implemented yet.
